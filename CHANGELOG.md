## [1.5.0] - 2021-07-29

### Added
* Implement Extend and FromIterator for RelativePathBuf ([#25]).

[#25]: https://github.com/udoprog/relative-path/pull/18

## [1.4.0] - 2021-05-04

### Added
* `to_logical_path` as an alternative method of converting into a path.

### Changed
* `set_extension` no longer needs to allocate.
* `set_file_name` implementation to more closely match
  `std::path::PathBuf::set_file_name`.

## [1.3.1], [1.3.2] - 2020-07-12

### Changed
* Minor documentation fixes.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-07-12

### Fixed
* Changed `to_path` to ignore platform-specific absolute components ([#18]).

[#18]: https://github.com/udoprog/relative-path/pull/18

## [1.2.1] - 2020-06-16

### Changed
* Change signature of `RelativePath::strip_prefix` to be the same as `std::path::Path` ([#16]).

### Added

### Changed

  who used it outside are on their own.

### Changed
* Deprecated use of `std::error::Error::description` in favor of just having a `std::fmt::Display` impl.

### Added
* Added `RelativePath::relative` to render a path relative from one path to another ([#14]).
