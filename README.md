# relative-path

Portable relative UTF-8 paths for Rust.

This provide a module analogous to [`std::path`], with the following characteristics:

* The path separator is set to a fixed character (`/`), regardless of platform.
* Relative paths cannot represent a path in the filesystem without first specifying what they
  are *relative to* through [`to_path`].
* Relative paths are always guaranteed to be a UTF-8 string.

On top of this we support many path-like operations that guarantee portable behavior.

### Serde Support

This library includes serde support that can be enabled with the `serde` feature.

### Why `std::path` is not portable

Windows permits using drive volumes as a prefix (e.g. `"c:\"`) and backslash (`\`) as a separator.

If we use `PathBuf`, Storing paths like this in a manifest would build and run on one platform, but potentially not others.

Consider the following manifest:

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Manifest {
    source: PathBuf,
}
```

Which represents this TOML file:

```toml
# Uh oh, trouble.
source = "C:\\path\\to\\source"
```

Assuming `"C:\\path\\to\\source"` is a legal path on Windows, this will
happily run for one platform when checked into source control but not others.

Since [`RelativePath`] strictly uses `/` as a separator it avoids this issue.
Anything non-slash will simply be considered part of a *distinct component*.

Conversion to [`Path`] may only happen if it is known which path it is relative to through the
`to_path` function. This is where the relative part of the name comes from.

```rust
use relative_path::RelativePath;
use std::path::Path;

let relative_path = RelativePath::new("foo/bar");
let path = Path::new("C:\\");
let full_path = relative_path.to_path(path);
```

This would permit relative paths to portably be used in project manifests or configurations.
Where files are referenced from some specific, well-known point in the filesystem.

```toml
source = "path/to/source"
```

A path like `C:\\path\\to\\source` should simply fail equally badly on both platforms.

The fixed manifest would look like this:

```rust
use relative_path::RelativePathBuf;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Manifest {
    source: RelativePathBuf,
}
```

### Path comparisons

When two relative paths are compared to each other, their exact component makeup is taken into
account:

```rust
use relative_path::RelativePath;

assert!(RelativePath::new("foo/bar/../baz") != RelativePath::new("foo/baz"));
```

Using platform-specific path separators to construct relative paths is not supported.

Path separators from other platforms are therefore treated as part of the component:

```rust
use relative_path::RelativePath;

assert_ne!(RelativePath::new("foo/bar"), RelativePath::new("foo\\bar"));

assert_eq!(1, RelativePath::new("foo\\bar").components().count());
assert_eq!(2, RelativePath::new("foo/bar").components().count());
```

To see if two logical paths are equivalent you can use [`normalize`]:

```rust
use relative_path::RelativePath;

assert_eq!(
    RelativePath::new("foo/bar/../baz").normalize(),
    RelativePath::new("foo/baz").normalize(),
);
```

### Additional portability notes

While relative paths avoid the most egregious portability issues, namely that absolute paths will work equally unwell on all platforms.
We do not avoid all.

This section tries to document additional portability issues that we know
about.

[`RelativePath`], similarly to [`Path`], makes no guarantees that the components represented in them
makes up legal file names.
While components are strictly separated by slashes, we can still store things in path components which may not be used as legal paths on all platforms.

* `NUL` is not permitted on unix platforms - this is a terminator in C-based filesystem APIs. Slash
(`/`) is also used as a path separator.
* Windows has a number of [reserved characters and names][windows-reserved].

As a relative path is converted, it's simply performed as a series of [`Path::push`] calls, one for each component.
This can cause varying results for each platform - i.e. a component containing a backslash on Windows would be seen as two separate components once converted.
This highlights the need to perform as many operations on relative paths as possible, rather then converting them first to their [`std::path`] equivalents.
